The AngelCalc class found in angelcalc.py has the following methods:
1. `boundTo180()` which converts any angle into it's reference angle in [-180, 179]
2. `isAngleBetween()` which determines if the `middle_angle` is between `first_angle` and `second_angle`.

The test_angelcalc.py file contains the unit tests for the methods which can be run just by running the file.
